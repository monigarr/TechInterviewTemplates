# Tech Interview Templates
- Tech interview templates to help discover technical talent.
- First Draft - please join our team to contribute your expertise from any background!
- Inspired by this article[Programmers confessing their sins](https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process?utm_content=50567654&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin) and the twitter convo about ridiculous ego driven tech interview experiences that waste time & resources. Thank You to [DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh) and [MissXu](https://twitter.com/MissXu) for inspiring the creation of this open source repo. I hope it can serve to be the respectful change we all strive for.

# Purpose
- Ensure technical interview is efficient at discovering people that can perform the job requirements.
- Focus on reaching the professional requirements & goals of hiring a human that is capable & willing to do the work. 
- Lessen hiring decisions with ego driven biases based on isms (race, age, gender, class, caste, religion, etc).
- Create and maintain dignity & respect in the technical interview. Machines memorize & spit out code on command. Humans are not machines.
